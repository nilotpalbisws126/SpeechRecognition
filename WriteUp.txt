You have to follow these steps to run this module

Step 1: Goto DigitRecognitionAssignment folder and run DigitRecognitionAssignment
Step 2: Choose option 1 for extracting feature from the train data, making a codebook and building the model.
Step 3: Press 2 for testing your live data. Recording module will appear and you have to utter any digit (0 to 9)
Step 4: It will predict what you said .

**************** File info****************

feature_ext.h has 3 main funtions train(), buildHMM() and testing()
Where train() reads the training digit data and writes a file called ciFeatures.txt after calculating capstrel coefficients.
buildHMM() takes the Ci values from codebook and makes observation sequence and also writes observationSeq.txt file under write folder and also it 
writes the filnal HMM model for each digit under /write/HMM_training folder
testing() takes the voice input and predicts what is said calculating the probability for each digit.


make_codebook.h has lbg() function which makes a codebook from the Ci values and writes a file LBG_log.txt under write folder.
